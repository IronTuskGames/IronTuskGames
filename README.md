## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Iron Tusk Games. I'm learning to program for the second time in my life and I think it is finally sticking. I'm focusing on Python, GD Script, and Godot to make games. 

<!--
**IronTuskGames/IronTuskGames** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm just getting started here and figured I should have this tool available to me for future needs. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small game in Godot 4.3
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how all this works
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with keeping up to date on the latest tools that make game development easier... 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at myprofilename  @gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm getting old and still trying to learn everything that I can, I worked as a dedicated game tester at Lucas Arts for The Force Unleashed 2 and Indiana Jones the Adventure Continues. I'm good at breaking stuff and am now trying to make stuff.
